Task
"What's the date today?"
To the question: "What is the date today?" we sometimes reply briefly: "5th of September", "16th of May", and so on. Your task is to get the date (number only).
Write a getDay function that takes the string answer (a string containing a date) as an argument and returns a number - the day of the month.
Examples:
• the getDay ("5th of September") function must return 5.
• getDay ("16th of May") function should return 16.
• getDay ("The 5th of April") function must return NaN.

Solution
function getDay (answer) {
 return parseInt (answer);
}
