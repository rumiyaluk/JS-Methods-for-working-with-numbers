Task
Changing a number depending on its sign
Write a function named changeNumber that takes the number num as an argument and doubles that number if it is positive, or reverses the sign of that number if it is negative.
Example:
â€¢ changeNumber (9) should return 18;
â€¢ the changeNumber (-7) function must return 7;
â€¢ the changeNumber (0) function must return 0.

Solution
function changeNumber (num) {
if (num> 0) return num * 2;
     else if (num <0) return (-num);
       else
       return 0;
}
