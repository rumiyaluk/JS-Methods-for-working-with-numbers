Distance in meters
The given distance is length in centimeters. Find the number of full meters in this distance. (1 m = 100 cm).
Write a function named distanceInMeters that takes length (distance in centimeters) as an argument and returns the number of full meters in that distance. Use the Math.floor () method.
Examples:
• distanceInMeters (4814) function should return 48;
• distanceInMeters (525) function should return 5;
• distanceInMeters (599) function should return 5.

Solution
function distanceInMeters (length) {
let cm = 100;
return Math.floor (length / cm);
}
