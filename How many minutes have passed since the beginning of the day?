Task
How many minutes have passed since the beginning of the day?
N seconds have passed since the beginning of the day. Find the total number of minutes that have passed since the start of the day.
Write a function called amountOfMinutes that takes n (the number of seconds) as an argument and returns the total number of minutes.
Examples:
• amountOfMinutes (7804) should return 130;
• amountOfMinutes (3630) should return 60.

Solution
function amountOfMinutes (n) {
let min = n / 60;
return Math.floor (min);
}
