How many offices does an office need to accommodate employees?
There are k workplaces in each office of the office. What is the smallest number of offices sufficient to accommodate the number of employees?
Write a function called officeRooms that takes the numbers k (the number of seats in one office) and number (the number of office employees) as arguments and returns the smallest number of offices needed to accommodate the number of employees.
Examples:
• the officeRooms (300, 5000) function should return 17;
• the officeRooms (250, 5150) function should return 21

Solution
function officeRooms(k, number){
 return Math.ceil(number / k);
}
