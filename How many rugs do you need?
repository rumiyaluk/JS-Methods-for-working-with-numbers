Task
How many rugs do you need?
You are given two positive integers a and b. a - corridor length, b - rug length. How many rugs (no overlap) are needed to cover the entire corridor?
 
Write a function called countOfRugs that takes the numbers a and b as arguments and returns the maximum number of rugs of length b needed to cover a corridor with length a. Use the Math.floor () method.
Examples:
• the countOfRugs (5, 2) function must return 2;
• the countOfRugs (30, 4) function must return 7;
• the countOfRugs (3, 4) function must return 0.

Solution
function countOfRugs (a, b) {
return Math.floor (a / b);
}
