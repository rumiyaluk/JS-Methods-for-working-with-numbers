Task
Is it true that 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3? It is not that simple!
Write a function isSumEqualsNumber that takes three fractional numbers a, b, c as arguments, and checks if the sum of the two fractional numbers is equal to the third fractional number, i.e. is the sum of a and b equal to c.
The function should return true (if the sum of the numbers after rounding is equal to the third number) or false otherwise.
Comment. Round the sum of the numbers and the third number to two decimal places using the toFixed (n) method.
Example:
â€¢ the isSumEqualsNumber (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) function must return true.

Solution
function isSumEqualsNumber (a, b, c) {
let sum = a + b;
if (sum.toFixed (2) === c.toFixed (2)) return true;
  else
  return false;
}
