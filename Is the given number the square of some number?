Task
Is the given number the square of some number?
Write a function called isSquare that takes x as an argument and returns a string like
• x is square of y, if the number x is the square of some number y,
• message x is not a square, if number x is not a square of an integer.
Indication. You need to check if the square root of a number is an integer. For example, the root of 9 is 3 (integer), the root of 7 is not an integer. You can check that the number x is an integer by checking if the condition x% 1 === 0 (this condition is true for integers and false for non-integers).
Examples:
• the isSquare (9) function must return "9 is square of 3";
• the isSquare (0) function must return "0 is square of 0";
• the isSquare (7) function must return "7 is not a square".

Solution
function isSquare (x) {
let y = Math.sqrt (x);
  if (y% 1 === 0) return `$ {x} is square of $ {y}`;
  else return `$ {x} is not a square`
  }
