Task
Purchase cost
Paying at the checkout for the purchased goods, you received a receipt, which contains the prices and the name of the goods in the form:
["18.7 salmon", "9.35 cheese", "2.99 milk", "9.99 chocolate bars"].
How much money should you pay for all purchases?
Write a function purchaseValue that takes a values array containing the prices and name of each item purchased as an argument and returns the total purchase price.
Examples:
• function purchaseValue (['1.31 bread', '7.96 cabbage', '2.10 candies', '0.84 salad']) should return 12.21.
• the function purchaseValue (['1.50 onion') must return 1.5.

Solution
function purchaseValue (values) {
let arr = values;
  let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <arr.length; i ++) {
      sum = sum + Number.parseFloat (arr [i]);
    }
    return sum;
}
