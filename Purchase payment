Purchase payment
Claudia buys sweets at the store, her purchase is $ XX.XX. She is going to pay in cash, she has a bundle of dollar bills, and there are no coins. What is the minimum amount of dollars Claudia must give to the cashier in order to pay for the purchase?
Write a function called numberOfDollars that takes cost as an argument and returns the minimum integer amount of dollars to be passed to the cashier for the purchase.
Examples:
• the numberOfDollars (12.75) function must return 13;
• the numberOfDollars (15.1) function must return 16.

Solution
function numberOfDollars (cost) {
return Math.ceil (cost);
}
