Task
Radians to degrees
Angles in mathematics are measured in degrees or radians. Conversion formula from radians to degrees:
 
Write a function convertRadiansToDegrees that takes n (angle in radians) as an argument and returns the angle in degrees. Round the result to 2 decimal places and return it as a number.
Examples:
• convertRadiansToDegrees (1) should return 57.30.
• convertRadiansToDegrees (2) should return 114.59.

Solution
function convertRadiansToDegrees (n) {
  let degrees = ((180 * n) / Math.PI) .toFixed (2);
   return + degrees;
}
