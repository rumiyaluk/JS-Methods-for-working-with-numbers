Task
Random phone number.
When testing the user registration page, you need to test the "Phone number" field. You have a lot of tests to do, and you decide to generate random phone numbers - 11-digit numbers. The phone number must start with a "+" character, the first digit of the number must be 1.
Write a function named createPhoneNumber that returns a random phone number as a 12-length string starting with '+1' and random digits.
Indication.
• Create a string containing the first two characters: '+1'.
• Create a loop that runs 10 times.
• In the body of the loop, get a random number from 0 to 9 and add this number to the string.
Example:
• the createPhoneNumber () function returns the phone number in the form "+12345678910"
function createPhoneNumber() {
 let s = '+1';
 for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
 {
   let x = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 10);
   s += x;
 }
 return s;
}
