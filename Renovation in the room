Renovation in the room
The surface area of the walls in the room is s square meters. The wallpaper tube is 10 meters long and w meters wide. How many minimum wallpaper tubes do you need to buy to make a renovation in a room?
Write a function called numberOfWallpapers that takes the numbers s (wall surface area) and w (wallpaper tube width) as arguments and returns the number of wallpaper tubes needed to repair.
Examples:
• the numberOfWallpapers (58, 0.5) function should return 12;
• numberOfWallpapers (36, 1) should return 4.

Solution
function numberOfWallpapers (s, w) {
 return Math.ceil (s / (10 * w));
}
