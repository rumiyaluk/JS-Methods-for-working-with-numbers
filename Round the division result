Task
Round the division result
You are given two numbers a, b. Find the quotient of these numbers, and round the result to the nearest whole number.
Write a function called quotient that takes two numbers a, b as arguments and returns the quotient of those numbers. Round the result to the nearest whole number.
Examples:
• the function quotient (59, 27) must return 2;
• the function quotient (50, 12) must return 4.

Solution
function quotient (a, b) {
return Math.round (a / b);
}
