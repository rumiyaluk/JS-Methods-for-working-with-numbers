Symmetrical point on the number axis
Points M and N are equally distant from point O, but located on opposite sides of it, in opposite directions.
 
Write a function called oppositePoint that takes the number x (the M-coordinate) as an argument and returns the N-coordinate as the string "N (x)".
Example:
• the oppositePoint (4) function must return "N (-4)";
• the oppositePoint (-4) function must return "N (4)";
• the oppositePoint (0) function must return "N (0)".

Solution
function oppositePoint (x) {
return x === 0? `N ($ {x})`: `N ($ {- x})`
}
