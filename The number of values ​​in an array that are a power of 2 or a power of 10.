Task
The number of values in an array that are a power of 2 or a power of 10.
Write a function countPowersInArray that takes an array arr as an argument and returns the number of power of 2 or power 10 elements in the array.
Examples:
• the countPowersInArray ([10, 100, 0.1, 4, 8]) function must return 5, since 10, 100, 0.1 are powers of 10, and numbers 4 and 8 are powers of 2.
• the countPowersInArray ([1, -10, 0]) function must return 1; (only 1 is a power of 10 and a power of 2)
• the countPowersInArray ([0]) function must return 0.

Solution
function countPowersInArray (arr) {
let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <arr.length; i ++) {
     if (Math.log10 (arr [i])% 1 === 0 || Math.log2 (arr [i])% 1 === 0)
    count ++;
  }
return count;
}
