Task
The smallest of the squares
Four numbers are given - the areas of four squares. Find the side of the smallest square.
Write a minSquareSide function that takes four numbers a, b, c, d (the area of four squares) as arguments and returns the side of the least square.
Example:
â€¢ the minSquareSide (9, 4, 16, 81) function must return 2 (the minimum area of a square = 4, its side = 2).

Solution
function minSquareSide (a, b, c, d) {
let squareOne = Math.sqrt (a);
let squareTwo = Math.sqrt (b);
let squareThree = Math.sqrt (c);
let squareFour = Math.sqrt (d);
return Math.min (squareOne, squareTwo, squareThree, squareFour);
}
