Weight in tons
Weight m is given in kilograms. Find the number of full tons in this weight. (1 t = 1000 kg).
Write a function named weightInTons that takes m (weight in kilograms) as an argument and returns the number of gross tons in that weight. Use the Math.floor () method.
Examples:
• the weightInTons (4163) function must return 4;
• the weightInTons (23789) function should return 23;
• the weightInTons (899) function must return 0.

Solution
function weightInTons (m) {
let kg = 1000;
return Math.floor (m / kg);
}
