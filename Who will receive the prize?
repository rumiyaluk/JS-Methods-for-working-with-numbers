Task
Who will receive the prize?
The swim was attended by 3 athletes. Competition results are stored as an array:
[[name1, time1], [name2, time2], [name3, time3]].
Determine the winner's time.
Write a function named victoryInSwim that takes an arr array containing the competition results as an argument and returns the fastest time. In all tests, the number of athletes is always 3.
Example:
â€¢ victoryInSwim ([['Nick', 8], ['Bob', 10], ['Kim', 6]]) should return 6.

Solution
function victoryInSwim (arr) {
  let newArr = arr.map (el => el [1]);
   return Math.min (... newArr);
}
